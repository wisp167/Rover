# Rover


## Short Demonstration

[Demo Clip](./Unity-clip.mp4)

## Installation

1. Clone the repo
> https://github.com/wisp167/Rover.git
2. Download and install Unity Hub [ https://unity.com/unity-hub ], then install Editor (for the highest compatibility recommend version 6000.0.39f1) in "Installs" tab of Hub. Some systems may encounter bug with endless installation of editor, in this case download engine manually from https://unity.com/releases/editor/archive and then add path to the folder in Hub.

## Dependancies for Training
For training as, project uses addon ml-agents as it provides API between Unity environment and python and also has implemented RL algorithms.

For installation follow guide in their web-docs [ https://unity-technologies.github.io/ml-agents/Installation/ ], I strongly recommend using python version 3.10.12. In this project was used version 1.0.0 of ml=agents.
